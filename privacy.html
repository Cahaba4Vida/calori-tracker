      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>
        Aethon helps you log food and weight data and optionally uses AI features (photo, label, voice, and coach chat)
        to generate estimates and coaching. This policy explains what we collect, how we use it, and your choices.
      </p>

      <h2>What we collect</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Account data</strong>: email and an internal user ID (if you sign in).</li>
        <li><strong>Food entries</strong>: calories and macros you log (manual, quick fill, AI-assisted).</li>
        <li><strong>Weight entries</strong>: weights you submit and timestamps/dates.</li>
        <li><strong>Goal & settings</strong>: target weight/date, macro goals, autopilot/cheat-day preferences.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage events</strong>: feature usage counts (for rate limits, debugging, and billing enforcement).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>AI features</h2>
      <p>
        When you use AI features (e.g., plate photo estimate, nutrition label scan, voice add, or coach chat),
        your input (text and/or an image/audio transcript) is sent to our AI provider to generate a response.
        We store the resulting nutrition numbers you save as entries. We do <strong>not</strong> need to store
        your original photo in order to save an entry.
      </p>
      <p style="opacity:0.85;">
        Note: your AI provider may process data to provide the service. Please avoid uploading sensitive personal data
        you do not want processed (e.g., medical documents, IDs).
      </p>

      <h2>Payments</h2>
      <p>
        If you subscribe, payments are handled by Stripe. We receive subscription status (e.g., active/trialing/canceled)
        to unlock premium features. We do not store your full payment card details.
      </p>

      <h2>How we use data</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Provide the core app experience (logging, totals, history, trends).</li>
        <li>Run Autopilot checks and generate coaching suggestions (when enabled).</li>
        <li>Enforce usage limits and prevent abuse.</li>
        <li>Maintain security, troubleshoot bugs, and improve reliability.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Data retention</h2>
      <p>
        We keep your logged entries and settings until you delete them (or delete your account/data where available).
        You can export your data from the app Settings.
      </p>

      <h2>Your choices</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>AI</strong>: you can choose not to use AI features and log manually.</li>
        <li><strong>Export</strong>: you can export your data from Settings.</li>
        <li><strong>Delete</strong>: you can delete individual entries from within the app.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>
        We use reasonable technical measures to protect your information. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.
      </p>

      <h2>Contact</h2>
      <p>
        If you have privacy questions, contact the app administrator/support email for your deployment.
